### Method: CA
```
Correspondence analysis (ca) is a generalized principal component analysis 
tailored for the analysis of qualitative data.
The goal of correspondence analysis is to transform a data table into 
two sets of factor scores: One for the rows and one for the columns.

Rows and columns are displayed as points on the map whose coordinates are the factor scores 
and where the dimensions are called factors.

The factor scores of the rows and the columns have the same variance. 
Therefore, both rows and columns can be conveniently represented in one single map.

In correspondence analysis, a mass to each row and a weight to each column is assigned. 
The mass of each row reflects its importance in the sample. 
The mass of each row is the proportion of this row in the total of the table.
The weight of each column reflects its importance for discriminating between the variables. 
So the weight of a column reflects the information this columns provides to the identification of a given row.
